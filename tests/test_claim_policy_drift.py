"""The bash mirror and the rego policy must never disagree.

`scripts/verify-claim.sh` (commit-time, pure bash) and `policy/claims.rego`
(PR-time, conftest) carry the same claim patterns. For years that duplication
was held together by a comment saying "Patterns MUST match policy/claims.rego"
and nothing checked, which is why the two could drift in silence.

This test runs BOTH implementations over the same corpus and fails when they
return different verdicts. Editing one side without the other now fails CI.

Verdict classes compared: "deny", "warn", "pass".

Two roots, because this file serves two callers:

  * ci-harness itself, and any consumer that vendored the files -- default.
  * A consuming repo, via the reusable-claims-policy template. That job checks
    out ci-harness into a side directory and runs this file with
    CLAIMS_REPO_ROOT pointing at the CONSUMER's tree, so the comparison is
    between the canonical policy and the mirror the consumer actually ships.

conftest is required. It is installed by the `[pr-claims-verified]` CI job; the
workflow step that runs this file asserts conftest is on PATH first, so the
skip below cannot hide a missing binary in CI.
