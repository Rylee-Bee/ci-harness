# policy/claims.rego
#
# Policy-as-code for commit messages and PR descriptions. Enforces
# the "Honesty is the simplest policy" rule from rylee.md
# (lines 170-195): a strong claim (counts, pass/fail) must include
# the command that produces the evidence and its observed output.
#
# Input contract: conftest is fed a JSON object of the shape
#   {"text": "<commit message or PR body>"}
# The CI job (.github/workflows/validate.yml -> the [pr-claims-verified] steps)
# builds this from GITHUB_EVENT_PATH (PR body); the commit-msg hook
# builds it from the commit message file. The rego rules are agnostic
# to the source.
#
# Two rule classes, mirroring compose.rego:
#   deny -- strong claim (counts, pass/fail) without command plus output
#          -> CI fails / hook blocks the commit.
#   warn -- soft claim ("should work", "verified") without a Verify
#          block -> CI passes, hook exits 0 with a warning.
#
# Scoping: whole-text, not per-paragraph. The PR template puts
# claims in `## What changed` and the evidence block in
# `## Verification` (separate paragraphs); same-paragraph scoping
# would break that flow. v1 goal: make the agent include SOME
# verify command. Widen to per-paragraph only if a false-negative
# is reported.
#
# Adding a pattern: append a regex to strong_claim_re or
# soft_claim_re, add a unit test in claims_test.rego, run
#   conftest verify --rego-version v0 --policy policy/
# (the --rego-version v0 flag is REQUIRED: conftest 0.46+ defaults to
# Rego v1 and every file in policy/ is v0 syntax. The header of
# claims_test.rego used to omit this flag -- following it verbatim
# failed to parse all five policy files.)
#
# The bash helper scripts/verify-claim.sh MUST carry the same patterns
# for the commit-msg hook. That duplication used to be held together by
# a comment and nothing else. tests/test_claim_policy_drift.py now
# runs both implementations over a shared corpus and fails on any
# disagreement -- see the "MIRROR" section there before editing either
# side. A one-sided edit fails CI instead of silently drifting.
#

# WIDENING 2026-10-06 -- what was added, and what was rejected as false
# positives
#
# Twelve real claims from an estate audit were run through the v1
# patterns. Exactly one was denied. The patterns below close the
# gaps that were measured, not guessed.
#
# Every candidate below was first measured against the 60 most recent
# merged homelab PR bodies (106k chars of real traffic that already
# passed this gate). "hits" = bodies the regex matches; a hit is only
# a problem if has_evidence is false, because a body that shows the
# command and its output is doing the thing the policy asks for.
#
#   ADDED  count nouns      4/60 newly hit. The "2 warnings in 0.13s"
#                           hit is pytest observed output, so
#                           has_evidence is true and nothing fires.
#   ADDED  no-number pf     9/60 hit, every one of them quoting a real
#                           pytest run ("All checks passed!" after a
#                           $ pytest line) -> has_evidence true.
#   ADDED  negative all-clear 1/60, ships its own git command.
#   ADDED  verb+now         0/60. Free.
#
#   REJECTED  completion verbs (merged|deployed|installed|shipped|
#   resolved|activated|promoted): 17/60 bodies match, and they are
#   overwhelmingly innocent. "bin/deployed-drift" is a real tool in
#   this repo, so the bare word collides with a filename;
#   "lab_content.py resolved its engine to ..." and "whether it is
#   installed ... is unverified" are ordinary prose, and the last is
#   already correct hedging. Denying on these would block honest PRs.
#   They stay out until a shape that does not collide is found.

package main

# Guard: if input.text is missing or not a string, no rules fire.
# This makes the policy safe to run against an empty API response
# (conftest exits 0; the CI job itself errors separately on a
# fetch failure).
text := input.text

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Strong claims: counts and pass/fail results.
#
# Rule 1 -- "<number> <countable noun>"
# The noun list is closed and alphabetical. It was widened from
# tests|errors|files|bytes|lines|jobs to cover the nouns an agent
# actually uses when describing this estate: "17 units, 0 missing",
# "0 vulnerabilities", "13 of 28 repos", "4 commits", "6 adapters".
#
# Rule 2 -- "<pass/fail verb> (in|on) <number>"  e.g. "passed in 22.77s"
#
# Rule 3 -- pass/fail asserted with NO number. This was the largest
# real gap: v1 only matched pass/fail next to a digit, so "All checks
# passed" and "every job is green" sailed through despite being
# exactly the claim the rule exists to police.
#
# Rule 4 -- negative all-clear: "no delta found", "nothing changed",
# "no issues detected". A false all-clear is worse than no claim at
# all, because it is trusted; this is the shape an unauthenticated
# or partial API read produces when it is mistaken for a full one.
#
# Rule 5 -- "<verb> now|again|still": "secret-scan passes now".
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE: these are written out in full rather than composed from shared
# fragments. Rego has no string concatenation, and a v1 attempt at
# `a := "x" + b` compiles to nothing -- conftest then exits 1 on the
# policy error and every input looks like a denial. Full literals
# cannot half-build. The rego<->bash equivalence is enforced by
# tests/test_claim_policy_drift.py, not by a shared constant.

# Rule 1: "<number> <countable noun>"
# "commits" was tried here and removed. Measured on 60 real merged PRs it
# caused 2 of the 3 regressions, both of them descriptive build metadata
# rather than claims: "Worker: MiniMax M3.1 (sandboxed offload agent,
# 2 commits)" and a `git log` table captioned "- 4 commits:". The one
# claim it would have caught ("150 commits sat merged, green and tested")
# is carried by "green" anyway. Low value, real friction.

#    a claim that checks are green. Denying it punishes honesty about
